# Project 04 2D-Platformer

Project for MSCH-C220
Completed 3/25/22

A simple game with two levels. The goal is to collect all 100 coins across both levels, while avoiding stationary enemies that can take away coins. 
Reach the final portal to complete the game.

## Implementation

Built using Godot 3.4.2
Required Features:
  Descriptive Readme.MD (i hope)
  No syntax errors
  No runtime errors
  User-controlled player that can jump
  Multiple enemies
  Reports score in HUD
  Functional save and load (Thanks again)

Additional features:
  Two (semi?) large levels, with implemented tileset from Kenney to replace some default models (portal, coin)
  Both player and enemy sprites were created by me using Kenney Creature Mixer
  Health counter in HUD
